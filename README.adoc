= What is timeline-monad?

*timeline-monad* is a JavaScript(ES6+) module of a minimal implementation for Functional Reactive Programming(FPP) that has a monad structure.

== TypeScript type definition
[source,ts]
./dist/build/modules/timeline-monad.d.ts
----
include::/dist/build/modules/timeline-monad.d.ts[]
----
 
[[Syntax]]
== Syntax

[source,js]
----
const timeFunction = (self) => { /*...*/ self[now] = value;};

const timeline = T( timeFunction );

const timeline1 = timeline
                         .sync( someFunction );
----

`T` is a function to return `timeline` object.

`timeFunction` is a function to define the `timeline` behavior with the argument `self` (`timeline` itself).

`timeFunction` is executed immediately by the `T` implementation, and when `self[now] = value` is defined, the `sync` method returns a value that `someFunction` is applied to. 

[TIP]
.**timeline-monad** is extremely simple and easy to learn.
====
`T`, `now` and `sync` are all of the reserved words and units provided by the module. Once some `timeline` is created, `sync` is the only method a programer cares.
====

== Example

`timeline` value is defined as `1` and later changed to `2`.

A timeline object can propagate the change to another timeline.

[[example.1]]
[source,js]
.example.1
----
include::/test-esm/sample01.js[lines=4..22]
----

[source,console]
.console

$ node -r esm ./test-esm/sample01.js

----
1
2 
10 <1>
----
<1> 1 second later

=== Step by step

Prepare a log function.

[source,js]

include::/test-esm/sample01.js[lines=4..7]
----

Some simple function.

[source,js]
----
include::/test-esm/sample01.js[lines=9]
----

An empty `timeline` is created.
The behavior of this timeline is defined by the rest of the code.

[source,js]
----
include::/test-esm/sample01.js[lines=11]
----
 
In this code block, the `timeline` value is defined as `1`.

[source,js]
----
include::/test-esm/sample01.js[lines=12]
----

It's easy and straightforward to read the current value.

[source,js]
----
include::/test-esm/sample01.js[lines=13]
----

The timeline method `sync` _observes_ and _maps_ the value of `timeline` to the value of `timeline1`.

[source,js]
----
include::/test-esm/sample01.js[lines=15..18]
----

1 second later, `timeline` value is changed to 3

[source,js]
----
include::/test-esm/sample01.js[lines=21..22]
----

[source,console]
.console

$ node -r esm ./test-esm/sample01.js

----

10 <1>

=== Make every time-function to a timeline

*timeline-monad* is designed to integrate any _mutable_ parts into timelines in functional programming scheme.

In <<example.1>>, two mutable parts remains:

- `setTimeout`
- `console`  

Both are objects that behave along _the time axis_ or we can say they are connected to _the real-world_.


The time and real-world looks like _mutable_ from the point of view of functional programming, generally speaking, they say so.

However, from the point of view of <<block-universe>> (discuss the details later), mutable objects are in fact, immutable objects that can be described by time-functions.

So, let's transform the both mutable objects to self-contained immutable timelines. 

`setTimeout` function in  <<example.1>> can be integrated into a self-contained timeline: `delayTL` by simply wrapping by `T()` see the <<Syntax>>

include::/test-esm/sample02.js[lines=22..27]
----

What is `console`? 

`console` object in JavaScript is a virtualization of the __physical console device__, and **a physical device can be abstracted as a time-function in functional programming**.

`console` transforms to a self-contained timeline: `consoleTL`.

=== Bunch of timelines

[source,console]
.console

$ node -r esm ./test-esm/sample02.js
